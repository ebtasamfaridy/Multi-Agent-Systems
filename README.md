# Multi-Agent-Systems
## B. Tech Project Final Year

The aim of the project is to develop a decentralized algorithm for each agent in a network to identify pose (translation and rotation) of a formation and to correctly assign itself to a unique position in the formation. Each agent will move towards its self-assigned position, and as time goes to infinity, the positions of the agents should exactly match those of a rotated and translated version of the desired formation. We will implement the proposed algorithm in MATLAB and will simulate a virtual network of robots.
The aim of this mid report is to thoroughly understand different consensus algorithms under different conditions, in a non-changing graph, changing graph on basis of certain parameters. Use mathematical analysis and matrix theory for the sufficient requirements for consensus. ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬Simulate consensus in different types of scenarios related to swarming, flocking and ones which can be used in real life applications.
